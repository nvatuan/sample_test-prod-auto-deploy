# sample_test-prod-auto-deploy
Testing out my Github Actions to auto deploy from TEST to PROD by auto merging branches, if the commit is considered safe to be deploy automatically. This is a simple github repo just to see how quickly I can have this feature if I start from scratch

- `MAIN` is always ahead or on-par with `PROD`
